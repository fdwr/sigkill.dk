Welcome to my website.  My name is Troels Henriksen, and I am a Danish
hacker ([more about me][1]) and general enthusiast in all matters
computing.  I am presently working as assistant professor at
[DIKU][diku], the computing department at the University of
Copenhagen, where I do research into optimising compilers for
data-parallel languages.  Concretely, I am working on [the Futhark
language and compiler][futhark].

On this site I present [programs I have written][2], my [configuration
files][3], and [minor scripts][4] that may of some amusement to
others.  I also have a [blog][5], which I may update from time to
time.  I tend to create categories before content (mirroring my
interest in type theory), so parts of the site may seem skeletal.
Please excuse any pompous introductions for folders containing naught
but a five-line shell script.

For those curious about technical details, this site is statically
generated via the nifty [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
framework, although it used to be written in shell script via the
pretty good [werc anti-framework][6].  The source code is available
[here][sigkillsource].
